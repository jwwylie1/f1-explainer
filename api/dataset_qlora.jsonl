This gives Hamilton context about how traffic is affecting lap times and helps him understand the pace of other competitors."}
{"input": "Instruction: Explain the following Formula 1 team radio message in simple terms, as if talking to someone unfamiliar with the sport. Make sure to clarify any racing-specific jargon or situations.\n\nRadio:  Okay, you had another track limit turn in line. So that was one too much. Every time you do another track limit, it would be another penalty.\nContext: Driver = Logan SARGEANT, Lap = 67, Compound = HARD, Position = P13, Gap ahead = 3.653s, Weather = Dry.\n\nExplanation: The team is warning Sargeant that he has exceeded the maximum number of track limit violations allowed and will now receive a penalty. From this point forward, every additional time he goes beyond the white lines marking the track boundaries will result in another penalty being added to his race time."}
{"input": "Instruction: Explain the following Formula 1 team radio message in simple terms, as if talking to someone unfamiliar with the sport.
